0- Mean and Covariance
Create a function mean_cov(X) that computes the mean and covariance of a dataset stored in a 2D numpy array, with error handling for invalid inputs.
1- Correlation
Implement a function correlation(C) that calculates a correlation matrix from a given covariance matrix, with checks for valid input types and dimensions.
2- Initialize
Build a MultiNormal class to represent a Multivariate Normal distribution, initializing it with data and calculating mean and covariance, while also handling invalid input.
3- PDF
Extend the MultiNormal class with a pdf(x) method to calculate the Probability Density Function (PDF) for a data point x, performing input validation and PDF calculation without using numpy.cov.
