0. A Python script that demonstrates list slicing by extracting specific sub-arrays from a predefined list of numbers
1. A Python script that extracts the 3rd and 4th columns from a 2D matrix to produce a new 2D matrix
2. Size Matters: A Python function that calculates the size of a matrix and returns the shape as (rows, columns).

3. Flip Me Over: A Python function that transposes a 2D matrix, swapping rows with columns.

4. Line Up: A Python function that adds two arrays element-wise. If they don't have the same shape, it returns None.

5. Across The Planes: A Python function that performs element-wise addition on two 2D matrices. Returns None for matrices of different shapes.

6. Howdy Partner: A Python function that concatenates two arrays.

7. Gettin Cozy: A Python function that concatenates two matrices along a specific axis. Returns None if they can't be concatenated.

8. Ridin Bareback: A Python function that multiplies two matrices. If the matrices can't be multiplied, it returns None.

9. Let The Butcher Slice It: A Python script that slices a given matrix to retrieve the middle rows, middle columns, and a bottom-right 3x3 square.

10. Iâ€™ll Use My Scale: A Python function that calculates and returns the shape of a numpy ndarray.

11. The Western Exchange: A Python function that transposes a matrix, switching its rows and columns.

12. Bracin The Elements: A Python function that performs element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two matrices.

13. Cat's Got Your Tongue: A Python function that concatenates two matrices along a specific axis using numpy.

14. Saddle Up: A Python function that performs matrix multiplication using two matrices and numpy.
