Magnitude of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) and Associated Factors
Overview
This project aims to investigate the prevalence and determinants of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) among post-operative patients at Myungsung Christian Medical Centre, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, using data from 2016 to 2022. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques, we seek to identify patterns and factors contributing to SSIs, enabling the development of targeted interventions to reduce their occurrence.

Objectives
To determine the incidence rate of SSIs among patients undergoing major surgeries.
To identify patient and surgery-related factors associated with the occurrence of SSIs.
To predict the likelihood of SSIs based on identified factors, aiding in prevention strategies.
To enrich the global knowledge base on SSIs, focusing on private healthcare settings in developing countries.
Dataset
The dataset comprises patient records from Myungsung Christian Medical Centre, focusing on individuals who underwent surgical procedures from 2016 to 2022. The data includes patient demographics, surgery details, and post-operative outcomes, with a particular emphasis on SSIs.

Methodology
The project involves:

Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify initial patterns and factors.
Implementation of Machine Learning models to analyze the data, compare the effectiveness of different optimization techniques, and predict SSI occurrences.
Tools and Technologies
Python for data processing and machine learning.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation; Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization; Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for machine learning.
Usage
The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that detail the analysis steps. To replicate the study or explore the data:

Clone the repository.
Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebooks in order, starting with data preprocessing, followed by EDA, model building, and evaluation.
Contribution

This project welcomes contributions from researchers and practitioners interested in improving post-operative care and reducing the incidence of SSIs. Suggestions for model improvement, additional data analysis, or implementation of newer AI techniques are highly appreciated.
