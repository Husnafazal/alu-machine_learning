One sort of unsupervised learning that is employed when you have unlabeled data is clustering [K-means] (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). This algorithm seeks to identify groups within the data, with the variable K denoting the number of groups found. Using the given features, the algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to one of K groups. The similarity of features is used to cluster data points.
